# Starbucks-Capstone-Project

This capstone project is to analyse customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. 
The data is constitued by 3 tables: transcript, portofolio and profile.
We need to investigate, wrangle and clean the data in order to get interpretable findings to understand customers' behaviors. And thus segment customers to provide efficient offers.  

## Library

Sklearn: RandomForest, LogisticRegression etc

## Project Motivation

The Starbucks Project is my Udacity Data Science Nano Degree Capstone Project. 
I am interested in how data can help analyse customer behaviors, segment customers and thus improve business performance. 


## Installation

Jupyter notebook 3.0 version and plus should be enough to showcase the project
